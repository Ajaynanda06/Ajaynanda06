ðŸ“ŒAbout Me
I am Ajay Polavarapu, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in C, C++, Embedded C, and Data Structures. Currently training at Vector India, Hyderabad, Iâ€™m working extensively with microcontrollers like ARM7 (LPC2129/LPC2148), 8051 and gaining in-depth knowledge of embedded hardware and software integration.

My focus areas include real-time operating systems (RTOS), Linux-based development, and communication protocols such as CAN, SPI, I2C, and UART. I enjoy problem-solving and continuously seek to improve system efficiency and reliability. My dedication to learning and building practical solutions is driven by a passion for coding, electronics, and system interfacing.

Iâ€™m looking forward to contributing to innovative embedded technology projects and growing in a challenging, fast-paced environment that values creativity and technical depth.
