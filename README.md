# 👋 About Me

I'm **Ajay Polavarapu**, an Embedded Systems trainee with strong programming skills in **C, C++, Embedded C**, and **Data Structures**. Currently training at **Vector India, Hyderabad**, I’m working extensively with microcontrollers like **ARM7 (LPC2129 / LPC2148)** and **8051**, while gaining deep knowledge in embedded hardware-software integration.

I focus on:

- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)**
- **Linux-based development**
- **Communication protocols** like CAN, SPI, I2C, UART

I'm passionate about problem-solving, optimizing embedded systems, and developing real-world solutions that are efficient, reliable, and elegant. My goal is to contribute to innovative embedded tech projects and grow in a challenging environment that values creativity and depth.
